# Mohamed Arish T P

I've used git and github before this and mostly don't feel confused about the content in this repository.

## Tasks

- [x] Create a branch
- [x] Create a pull request
- [x] Create a readme
- [x] Add relevant data to the readme file


### Review on the course
- I liked this course.
- This makes more people know about vcs using git and remote repositories using github and that is a good thing.
